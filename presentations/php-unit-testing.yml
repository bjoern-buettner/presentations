  - title: What is Unit Testing
    list:
      - Unit Testing is testing a unit of code in isolation
      - Unit Testing is usually done before the code is committed
      - Unit Testing is usually done on the developer's machine and on the CI server
    notes:
      - Unit Testing is usually done on a single class or function
      - Unit Testing is usually pretty fast
      - Unit Testing can be done in real time in IDEs
  - title: What is a Unit?
    list:
      - A unit is usually a class or a function
      - A unit is a small part of the codebase
      - A unit is a part of the codebase that can be tested in isolation
    notes:
      - A unit is a class or a function
      - A unit is a small part of the codebase
      - A unit is a small part of the codebase that can be tested in isolation
  - title: What is makes Unit Testing difficult?
    list:
      - When the code is not using dependency injection
      - When the code is using static functions
      - When the code is using built-in functions
      - When the code is using global state
    notes:
      - Dependency Injection allows for easy isolation of tested code
      - Static functions are hard to mock
      - Built-in functions are hard to mock
      - Global state is hard to control

      - title: Theory
        list:
          - Describe...
          - When...
          - Action...
          - Then...
        notes:
          - Describe what you are testing in the method name
          - First set up the test case
          - Then do the action you want to test
          - Last assert or expect the result(s)
      - title: Example
        lang: php
        code: |
          class CalculatorTest extends TestCase
          {
              /** @test */
              public function whenTwoNumbersAreProvidedTheSumIsCalculated()
              {
                  $calculator = new Calculator();
                  $result = $calculator->add(1, 2);
                  self::assertEquals(3, $result);
              }
          }
        notes:
          - Declare a method with a speaking name
          - Add the @test annotation
          - Create the object you want to test
          - Call the method you want to test
          - Assert or expect the result
  - title: What to Mock and what to Stub?
    list:
      - Mock the relevant dependencies of the unit
      - Do not mock pure logic-less Objects (DTOs, Entities, Value Objects)
      - Stub any dependency that is not relevant for the test
      - Do not mock the unit you are testing
    notes:
      - This includes most of the dependencies of the constructor and the method called
      - Pure logic-less Objects are usually just data containers
      - Stubbing objects like loggers makes it easier to test the unit
      - Mocking the unit itself makes the test useless
  - title: What to Expect or Assert?
    list:
      - Assert the result of the unit
      - Expect calls on Mocks
      - Assert the state of the unit for logic-less Objects (DTOs, Entities, Value Objects)
    notes:
      - If the unit returns a value, assert that value
      - If the unit calls a dependency, expect that call
      - If the unit changes the state of a logic-less Object, assert that state
